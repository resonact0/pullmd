description: "Read any web page as clean Markdown using PullMD. Use this skill whenever you need to fetch, read, extract, or summarize content from a URL or website. This includes when the user says 'read this page', 'what does this URL say', 'fetch this article', 'summarize this link', 'get the content from...', or when you need web content as context for another task. Also use this when WebFetch fails or returns poor results — PullMD produces cleaner Markdown than raw HTML parsing. Do NOT use this for GitHub URLs (use gh CLI instead) or for API endpoints that return JSON."

# Web Reader — PullMD Integration

Read web pages as clean, structured Markdown via the self-hosted PullMD service. Falls back gracefully to WebFetch if PullMD is unavailable.

## Why PullMD over WebFetch

PullMD runs a 4-stage extraction pipeline:

1. **Reddit** — auto-detected URLs go through Reddit's JSON API with full comment trees.
2. **Cloudflare** — sites that support `Accept: text/markdown` get native Markdown directly.
3. **Static HTML** — Mozilla Readability and Trafilatura run in parallel; the higher-quality output wins.
4. **Headless Chromium fallback** — when static extraction returns body-soup or low-quality output (typical for Next.js / SPA pages), the page is rendered in a real browser before extracting.

The result is much cleaner than the raw HTML that WebFetch returns, and it works on JavaScript-heavy sites that WebFetch can't handle at all.

## How to use

### Step 1: Fetch via PullMD

Use Bash to curl the PullMD API. This is preferred over WebFetch because it returns clean Markdown directly:

```bash
curl -s "__PULLMD_URL__/api?url=<URL>"
```

The response is `text/markdown` — ready to use as-is.

**Available parameters:**

| Param           | Default | Notes                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`           | —       | Required.                                                                   |
| `comments`      | `true`  | Include Reddit comments. Ignored for non-Reddit URLs.                       |
| `comment_depth` | `3`     | Reddit comment nesting depth (1–10).                                        |
| `comment_limit` | `15`    | Max top-level Reddit comments.                                              |
| `frontmatter`   | `false` | Prepend YAML metadata (title, source, quality, share id, …).                |
| `format`        | `md`    | `text` strips Markdown; `json` returns a structured response with metadata. |
| `nocache`       | `false` | Bypass the 1-hour cache and refetch from source.                            |
| `render`        | auto    | `force` → always render via Playwright. `skip` → never render. Bypasses cache. |
| `lang`          | `de`    | Language for the comments-section header (`de` or `en`).                    |

**Response headers worth checking:**

- `X-Source` — `reddit` · `cloudflare` · `readability` · `readability-fallback` · `trafilatura` · `playwright`
- `X-Quality` — `0.0–1.0` extraction confidence (low values mean the static extraction was thin or noisy)
- `X-Share-Id` — 8-hex permalink, openable as `__PULLMD_URL__/s/<id>`

**Example calls:**

```bash
# Read an article
curl -s "__PULLMD_URL__/api?url=https://example.com/article"

# Read a Reddit post with comments
curl -s "__PULLMD_URL__/api?url=https://reddit.com/r/node/comments/abc/title/&comments=true"

# Get fresh (uncached) content
curl -s "__PULLMD_URL__/api?url=https://example.com/news&nocache=true"

# Force the Playwright fallback for a JS-rendered page that didn't trigger
# the auto-detection (or where you want to be sure)
curl -s "__PULLMD_URL__/api?url=https://mistral.ai/pricing&render=force"
```

### Step 2: Check if it worked

If curl returns valid Markdown (starts with `#` or contains readable text), use that content. The `X-Source` response header tells you which extraction method was used. If `X-Source: playwright`, the page needed JavaScript rendering — that's normal for SPAs (Next.js, React, Vue dashboards, …).

### Step 3: Fallback to WebFetch

If PullMD fails (network error, timeout, empty response), fall back to the built-in WebFetch tool:

```
WebFetch(url="<URL>", prompt="Extract the main content of this page")
```

This still works but produces noisier output since it processes raw HTML.

## Decision flow

```
Need to read a web page?
├── Is it a GitHub URL? → Use `gh` CLI instead
├── Is it a JSON API? → Use curl/fetch directly
└── It's a regular web page:
    ├── Try: curl PullMD API
    │   ├── Success (got Markdown) → Use it
    │   └── Failed (error/timeout/empty) → Fallback below
    └── Fallback: WebFetch tool
```

## Tips

- PullMD caches results for 1 hour. Use `nocache=true` if you need the latest version. `render=force|skip` also bypasses the cache.
- For pages with important comments or discussions (forums, HN, Reddit), add `comments=true` to include the discussion below the post.
- For JS-rendered apps where the auto-fallback didn't fire (e.g. content lives in a tab the heuristic didn't reach), `render=force` re-extracts via headless Chromium.
- Reddit URLs are automatically detected (incl. `redd.it` short links and `/r/<sub>/s/<id>` share links) and use a specialized extraction pipeline that handles posts, comments, galleries, and videos.
- The `/api/history` endpoint shows recent conversions — useful for checking what's been fetched: `curl -s "__PULLMD_URL__/api/history?limit=5"`.
- Persistent share links: every successful conversion gets an 8-hex `share_id`. `GET __PULLMD_URL__/s/<id>` returns the cached markdown and re-fetches from source if older than one hour — useful as a stable URL that always returns fresh content.
