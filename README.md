# PullMD

Self-hosted URL-to-Markdown service for humans and AI agents.

PullMD takes any web URL and returns clean, readable Markdown — no
navigation, no ads, no boilerplate. It auto-detects Reddit threads
(with full comment trees), uses Cloudflare's native Markdown when
available, runs Mozilla Readability + Trafilatura on static HTML,
and as a last resort renders JavaScript-heavy pages via headless
Chromium (Playwright sidecar) before extracting.

It ships as:

- a **PWA frontend** with dark/paper themes, history, archive, share links
- a **REST API** at `GET /api?url=…`
- an **MCP server** at `POST /mcp` (Streamable-HTTP transport, stateless)
- a **Claude Code skill** as a downloadable zip

Every conversion gets an 8-hex **share id** that works as a stable
live-endpoint: `GET /s/:id` returns the cached markdown and
re-fetches from the source if older than one hour. Use the share id
as a fixed URL that always returns fresh content — useful for
subreddit feeds and similar.

## Quick start

Pre-built multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) live on Docker
Hub. Drop the compose file somewhere and run:

```bash
mkdir pullmd && cd pullmd
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
# → http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. No `.env` needed: every variable has a sensible default
and PullMD listens on port `3000`. Add a `.env` next to the compose
file to override anything (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### `docker-compose.yml` (zero-config)

```yaml
services:
  pullmd:
    image: aeternalabshq/pullmd:latest
    container_name: pullmd
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-3000}:3000"
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_URL=${PUBLIC_URL:-http://localhost:${PORT:-3000}}
      - TRAFILATURA_URL=http://trafilatura:8001/extract
      - PLAYWRIGHT_URL=http://playwright:8002/render
      - REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=${REDDIT_CLIENT_ID:-}
      - REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=${REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET:-}
      - REDDIT_USER_AGENT=${REDDIT_USER_AGENT:-}
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    networks:
      - pullmd-internal
    depends_on:
      - trafilatura
      - playwright

  trafilatura:
    image: aeternalabshq/pullmd-trafilatura:latest
    container_name: pullmd-trafilatura
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - pullmd-internal

  playwright:
    image: aeternalabshq/pullmd-playwright:latest
    container_name: pullmd-playwright
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - pullmd-internal

networks:
  pullmd-internal:
    driver: bridge
```

> **Note:** the Playwright sidecar adds **~3.7 GB** to your image cache
> (Chromium + Firefox + WebKit binaries from the official Playwright
> base image). It's optional — leave `PLAYWRIGHT_URL` unset and the
> `playwright` service block off, and PullMD silently degrades to
> static extraction with a fallback note in the metadata.

> **Mirror on GHCR:** `ghcr.io/aeternalabshq/{pullmd,pullmd-trafilatura,pullmd-playwright}`.
> Replace the `image:` lines if you prefer GitHub's registry.

### Behind Traefik

For deployments behind Traefik with TLS, use `docker-compose.traefik.yml`
instead. Same images, but with Traefik labels and the `proxy` external
network. Set `HOST_DOMAIN` in `.env`:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/main/docker-compose.traefik.yml
echo "HOST_DOMAIN=pullmd.example.com" > .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```

### Local development (no Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd.git
cd pullmd
npm install
npm start             # http://localhost:3000
npm test              # node --test
```

## Configuration

All variables go in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

| Variable               | Required | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOST_DOMAIN`          | yes      | Public hostname without scheme. Used by Traefik routing and as fallback for `PUBLIC_URL`.           |
| `PUBLIC_URL`           | no       | Full public origin embedded in `/help` and the skill zip. Defaults to `https://${HOST_DOMAIN}`.     |
| `TRAFILATURA_URL`      | no       | URL of the Trafilatura sidecar's `/extract` endpoint. Unset → skip Trafilatura, Readability only.    |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_URL`       | no       | URL of the Playwright sidecar's `/render` endpoint. Unset → skip Playwright fallback for JS pages.   |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`     | no       | OAuth credentials for Reddit. Without them, PullMD uses the public JSON API (lower rate limit).     |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | no       |                                                                                                      |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`    | no       | Reddit requires a unique UA. Default: `PullMD/1.0 (URL-to-Markdown service)`.                       |

`PUBLIC_URL` matters for self-hosting: the help page and downloadable
skill embed it as the canonical endpoint. Set it correctly and your
users get a copy-paste setup that points at *your* instance.

## API

| Endpoint               | Returns                                                                          |

| `GET /web-reader.zip`  | Claude Code skill bundle, with this instance's URL baked in.                     |
| `GET /help`            | Bilingual user/agent setup guide.                                                |

### `/api` parameters

| Param           | Default | Notes                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`           | —       | Required.                                                                          |
| `comments`      | `true`  | Include Reddit comments. Ignored for non-Reddit URLs.                              |
| `comment_depth` | `3`     | Max nesting depth (1–10).                                                          |
| `comment_limit` | `15`    | Max top-level comments.                                                            |
| `frontmatter`   | `false` | Prepend YAML metadata.                                                             |
| `format`        | `md`    | `text` strips Markdown; `json` returns structured response.                        |
| `nocache`       | `false` | Bypass the 1-hour cache.                                                           |
| `render`        | auto    | `force` → always render via Playwright. `skip` → never render. Bypasses cache.     |
| `lang`          | `de`    | Comments-section header language (`de` or `en`).                                   |

### Response headers

- `X-Source` — `reddit` · `cloudflare` · `readability` · `readability-fallback` · `trafilatura` · `playwright`
- `X-Quality` — `0.0`–`1.0` extraction confidence
- `X-Share-Id` — the 8-hex permalink id

---

## Cache & TTLs

- **`/api?url=…`** re-fetches from source if the cache row is older than **1 hour**.
- **`/s/:id`** does the same on-demand refresh, so share links double as live endpoints.
- Cache rows are pruned **90 days** after the last write. `/s/:id` hits keep the row alive (since they trigger refresh + write); read-only access does not extend the TTL.
- If the source is unreachable on refresh, the last good snapshot is served — share links keep working even when the original URL dies.

---

## AI-agent integration

Once your instance is running, `https://${HOST_DOMAIN}/help` shows
copy-paste setup boxes for three install paths:

1. **Universal prompt** — drop into any chat agent (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, …).
2. **Claude Code skill** — `web-reader.zip`, auto-built with your URL embedded.
3. **MCP server** — point any MCP-capable host at `https://${HOST_DOMAIN}/mcp`.

   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http pullmd https://${HOST_DOMAIN}/mcp
   ```

   The MCP server exposes three tools: `read_url`, `get_share`, `list_recent`.

---

## Architecture

- `server.js` — Express app factory (`createApp`) with dependency injection for tests. Exposes `/api` and `/api/stream` (SSE).
- `lib/reddit.js` — Reddit URL normalization, redirect resolution, post + comment extraction.
- `lib/web.js` — Orchestrator: Cloudflare-Markdown short-circuit, then static Readability + Trafilatura with `pickBest`, then optional Playwright re-render + re-extract on body-soup / low-quality output.
- `lib/render-decision.js` — Predicate that decides when to fall back to Playwright (readability-fellback + thin, body-soup signature, or quality < 0.5; plus `force` / `skip` overrides).
- `lib/playwright-client.js` — HTTP client for the Playwright sidecar with `AbortSignal` propagation for SSE-disconnect cancellation.
- `lib/scoring.js` — Quality scoring used to pick between extractors and as a render-trigger heuristic.
- `lib/cache.js` — SQLite cache (`better-sqlite3`) with 90-day TTL and 8-hex share ids.
- `lib/mcp.js` — Stateless MCP server registering the three tools.
- `lib/distrib.js` — Public-URL substitution in `/help` and `/web-reader.zip`.
- `trafilatura-sidecar/` — Python sidecar (FastAPI) wrapping Trafilatura.
- `playwright-sidecar/` — Python sidecar (FastAPI + Playwright + Chromium) for JS-rendered pages.
- `public/` — PWA frontend (vanilla JS, dark/paper themes, service worker, EventSource client for `/api/stream`).
- `skill/web-reader/` — Claude Code skill source (templated with `__PULLMD_URL__`).
