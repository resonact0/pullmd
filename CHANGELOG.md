## [3.5.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Recipe-defined frontmatter fields.** Site recipes can now inject custom frontmatter fields via a new `frontmatter` block, sourced from a page's embedded JSON-LD (`<script type="application/ld+json">`, selected by schema.org `@type` and resolved with a dot-path) or from CSS selectors. Field names are validated (letter-led, ≤ 64 chars); pipeline-computed names (provenance, share/cache bookkeeping, media/LLM-usage) are reserved and reject the recipe, while metadata-derived names (`title`, `author`, `published`, `modified`, `description`, `language`, `image`, `site`) are overridable and beat the generic scrape on a collision. When `PULLMD_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` is set as an allowlist, recipe fields it drops are surfaced in the startup log and in the new `filteredFrontmatterFields` array of `GET /api/recipes/status`.
- **Booking.com hotel-listing recipes** (`booking-hotel-noise`, `booking-hotel-frontmatter`, closes #40). Hotel pages (`/hotel/**`) are rendered via Playwright (the raw response is an AWS-WAF challenge shell), page chrome is stripped (header/footer/searchbox, gallery, breadcrumbs, Genius/promo banners, review-avatar flags, payment-card images, lazy-loading Q&A skeleton), and the Hotel JSON-LD is mapped into frontmatter (`description`, `address`, `rating`, `rating_best`, `review_count`, `price_range`). The body keeps the hotel description, popular facilities, room table (with prices when the URL carries `checkin`/`checkout` dates), house rules and fine print.
- **Site-recipe contributor guide** ([`SITE-RECIPES.md`](./SITE-RECIPES.md)), documenting the recipe engine end to end — matching and merge semantics, the full schema, rendered-DOM handling, JSON-LD-to-frontmatter, and the testing/PR workflow — with a pointer added from the README.

### Fixed

- Recipe `select.remove` now also applies to the HTML sent to the Trafilatura sidecar — previously it was a silent no-op whenever the quality auto-pick chose Trafilatura, so recipe-removed elements still leaked into the output. Selectors are now applied one by one, so an invalid selector is skipped individually instead of risking whole-page extraction failure.

---

## [3.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Query-scoped extraction** (`?query=`). `GET /api` and the MCP `read_url` tool accept an optional `query` param that returns only the sections of the page relevant to that text - a BM25 ranking over heading-based sections of the converted markdown (paragraph-level fallback for pages with fewer than two headings), with no network calls and no LLM involved. Budget via `max_tokens` (default `600`, range `64`-`20000`). Falls back to the whole page (`confidence: low`) when nothing in the page scores against the query, or when the page is already small enough that extraction wouldn't help. New response headers (`X-Extracted`, `X-Extract-Confidence`, `X-Extract-Sections`, `X-Extract-Original-Tokens`, `X-Extract-Returned-Tokens`), a `format=json` `extract` object, and `?frontmatter=true` fields (`extracted`, `extract_confidence`, `sections_selected`, `original_tokens`, `returned_tokens`) expose the result. Extraction runs on the already-cached full page, so multiple `query` values against one URL cost a single fetch within the normal cache TTL. Omitting `query` (or passing an empty/whitespace-only value) leaves `/api` output byte-identical to pre-3.4 behavior.

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-07-08

### Security

- **Block Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** (closes #41). The URL-fetch endpoints (`GET /api`, the MCP `read_url` tool, and the Reddit/web/Playwright fetch paths behind them) now resolve the target host and reject any resolved address in the private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT or cloud-metadata ranges - including `169.254.169.254` and `100.100.100.200`, the addresses used by the reported exploit. Each redirect hop is re-checked before it is followed, and the Playwright sidecar path is validated Node-side before dispatch. Requests to a blocked host return HTTP 403.
- Self-hosters who intentionally need an internal host (e.g. an intranet wiki) can allowlist specific CIDRs and/or exact hostnames via the new `PULLMD_ALLOWED_HOSTS` env var (comma-separated, empty by default = block all internal targets). See `.env.example`.
- **Known residual:** the guard checks resolved IPs at request time but does not pin the outbound socket to the checked address, so a DNS-rebinding attack (where the name resolves differently between the check and the actual connection) is not fully closed by this fix. When running behind an outbound HTTP proxy, the proxy performs its own name resolution, so its egress filtering - not this guard - is the authoritative layer for traffic it forwards.

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **`X-Transcript-Status` response header** (#37, closes #36). YouTube conversions now expose the transcript state (`ok` / `none` / `blocked` / `error`) as a response header, so programmatic consumers can tell a transient block from a genuinely absent transcript without parsing the body.
- **ScienceDaily lead-image recipe.** A shipped site recipe for `*.sciencedaily.com/releases/**` unwraps the article's `#text` container so the lead image survives extraction. Without it, Readability picks the paragraph-dense inner block as the article and drops the sibling `<figure>` that holds the real lead image. General sites should still rely on the `image` frontmatter field (from `og:image`) for a robust lead-image source.

### Fixed

- **Cache hits now serve complete metadata.** The cached-response path rebuilt a minimal `{title, url, quality}` object, so on a cache hit the frontmatter lost `image` (`og:image`/`twitter:image`), `description`, `author`, `language`, and `site`, and `format=json` returned `metadata: null`. The full metadata persisted at extraction time (in the existing `metadata` column) is now served on cache hits in both the frontmatter and the `format=json` response - no schema change needed. Consumers reading `metadata.ogImage` / `metadata.twitterImage` (e.g. for an article lead image) now get it on cached pages too.
- **Tracking pixels no longer leak into the Markdown.** 1x1 invisible beacon images (e.g. republish/analytics counters embedded inline in article text) were kept by Readability and rendered as bogus Markdown images. `cleanDom` now drops any `<img>` whose declared width and height are both ≤ 1; genuine wide/tall banners (only one tiny dimension) are spared.
- **YouTube: transient 429 distinguished from a missing transcript** (#34, closes #33). A per-IP 429 on the timedtext endpoint was mislabeled as a permanent block; it is now classified honestly and not cached, so a later retry can pick up the now-available transcript.
- **Sidecar: bundle `yt_transcript.py` in the markitdown image** (#35). The YouTube transcript helper was missing from the built image; it is now copied explicitly.

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Dedicated Hacker News pipeline.** Hacker News URLs - item pages, individual comment permalinks, and listings (`/`, `/news`, `/newest`, `/ask`, `/show`, `/jobs`, `/best`) - are now extracted through a purpose-built converter (via the HN API) instead of the generic HTML path. The result is a clean nested comment tree with per-comment permalinks and a `## Comments (N of M)` heading, replacing the layout-table soup the old path produced. Comment depth honors the existing `comment_depth` control, and extraction failures fall back to the generic web pipeline. New `source: hackernews` value and an HN-orange source badge in the PWA.
- **PWA: share the converted Markdown** (Web Share API). A share button next to Copy hands the current Markdown - exactly what is shown and copied, including the frontmatter block when the toggle is on - to the native OS/app share sheet. It appears only where the browser supports Web Share (e.g. mobile, Safari); on a non-cancel failure it falls back to copying so the content is never lost.

### Changed

- **PWA: the Frontmatter toggle updates the output instantly.** Flipping the Frontmatter switch now adds or removes the YAML block immediately, with no second Pull. The Copy and Share buttons and the character count follow the toggle.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-10

### Breaking

- **Clean markdown body by default.** The inline source-attribution line (`**domain** · fetched` + url, or `**filename** · fetched` for local files) is no longer emitted in the response body. The same applies to Reddit posts: the inline meta line (`**r/sub** · u/user · N ↑ · age · date` + url) is gone from the body; subreddit, author, upvotes, and publish date move into the frontmatter (`subreddit`, `author`, `upvotes`, `published`). The body now starts with `# Title` and goes straight into content. The source URL, fetch date, and all extraction metadata are unaffected - they remain in the YAML frontmatter as before. Set `PULLMD_SOURCE_HEADER=true` to restore the legacy inline header verbatim. Self-hosters upgrading from v2.x should review `MIGRATION.md`.

### Added

- **`PULLMD_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` allowlist.** Comma-separated list of frontmatter field names to include in the YAML block (e.g. `title,url,source,llm_tokens`). Unset - all fields are emitted (backward-compatible). Unknown names are silently ignored with a one-time startup warning; if every listed name is unknown, the allowlist is ignored and all fields are emitted as a safe fallback.
- **Document conversion via the MarkItDown sidecar** (`MARKITDOWN_URL`). New `POST /api/file` endpoint accepts raw document bytes (25 MB cap) for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, EPUB, ZIP, CSV, JSON, XML, and more. Non-HTML URLs detected as documents are also routed through the sidecar automatically in `extractWeb`. If `MARKITDOWN_URL` is unset, the document path is disabled and `/api/file` returns `502`. These features were developed incrementally as versions 2.7.0-2.10.0 on the release branch but are first officially released here in 3.0.0.
- **Opt-in media tier** (`PULLMD_VISION_*` / `PULLMD_STT_*`). Image captioning and audio transcription (Whisper STT) run inside pullmd itself - no markitdown container needed. Per-modality or shared OpenAI-compatible credentials; each modality is enabled when its key is set. The PWA accepts image and audio uploads when the tier is enabled. Off by default; cloud backends cost per call and send content off-host - point `*_BASE_URL` at a local server to keep everything on-host.
- **Keyless YouTube transcripts** (`MARKITDOWN_YOUTUBE=true`). Routes YouTube URLs through the sidecar for title + description + full transcript. No API key required. Configurable timecodes (`yt_timecodes`: `links`/`plain`/`none`), block chunking (`yt_chunk`), preferred languages, and optional proxy. All options are also overridable per-request via query params on `/api` and the MCP `read_url` tool.
- **Opt-in high-quality PDF tier** (`PULLMD_PDF_OCR_API_KEY` / `PULLMD_PDF_OCR_BASE_URL` / `PULLMD_PDF_OCR_MODEL`). Route PDFs through a vendor-neutral OCR provider that preserves tables - reference provider is Mistral OCR (`mistral-ocr-latest`, ~$0.002/page). Triggered per request with `?pdf=ocr` (on `/api`, `/api/stream`, `/api/file`, and the MCP `read_url` tool via `pdf_ocr`) or a recipe `fetch.pdf: ocr` default. Default PDF handling is unchanged (free markitdown path). OCR failures fall back to markitdown automatically. New `source: pdf-ocr` value and `pdf_pages` frontmatter field.
- **LLM-usage and media metadata in frontmatter.** When media or LLM features run, the response frontmatter carries `llm_model`, `llm_tokens`, `llm_prompt_tokens`, `llm_completion_tokens`, `audio_seconds`, `image_size`, and (for YouTube) `duration` and `views`. Media and channel metadata is emitted frontmatter-only - consistent with the v3 clean-body direction.

### Changed

- **Claude Code skill bundle renamed `web-reader` → `pullmd`.** Now served at `GET /pullmd.zip`; the old `/web-reader.zip` URL responds with a permanent redirect. **Existing installs are not replaced by the new zip** - remove the old skill first (`rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/web-reader`) or both will be active side by side. See `MIGRATION.md`.
- The MCP `read_url` tool description and the skill instructions now cover the v3 capabilities (documents, YouTube transcripts, media captioning/transcription, PDF OCR), and the MCP server reports the real package version.
- Media conversion results carry per-modality `source` labels (`image-caption` / `audio-transcript`) instead of a generic `markitdown`.

### Fixed

- **Relative image and link URLs are now resolved against the source page** before extraction. Previously, root-relative paths (e.g. `/images/photo.webp`) survived into the markdown verbatim and rendered as broken images on share pages.
- Document conversions in the markitdown sidecar run in a sandboxed child process with a wall-clock timeout and optional memory cap, so a pathological file can't pin the sidecar (DoS hardening).
- Media frontmatter (image size, LLM usage, YouTube meta) survives the cache - cached responses now carry the same fields as the first request.

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Convert local HTML files** ([#28](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/28)). New `POST /api/html` endpoint accepts a raw HTML body (max 10 MB) and runs it through the existing Readability + Trafilatura extraction pipeline — `curl --data-binary @page.html -H 'Content-Type: text/html' …/api/html`. Optional `url=` re-enables site recipes and the linked header; the file name can be passed via `?filename=` or the `X-Filename` header (URI-encoded; keeps names out of access logs); `data:`-URI images (SingleFile exports) are replaced by their alt text. Privacy by design: local files are never cached — no history entry, no share link, and telemetry logs a constant placeholder instead of the file name. Playwright is deliberately unavailable for uploaded HTML (user-supplied markup must never run in a server-side browser).
- **PWA: convert a local `.html` file** - drag-and-drop it onto the page (desktop), or click/tap the dashed hint below the URL field to pick a file. The file picker works on **desktop and mobile**, so a downloaded page can be converted on a phone too. Friendly errors for non-HTML files, oversized files (413), and JavaScript app shells (422).

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Sessions no longer die a hard 7 days after login regardless of activity** ([#26](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/26)). The session cookie is now re-issued with a fresh `Max-Age` whenever the DB-side sliding expiry bumps (existing once-per-minute throttle), so browser cookie and DB session finally slide together.

### Changed
- **Session TTL raised from 7 to 90 days** (sliding). Anyone active at least once every 90 days stays logged in.
- **Expired session in the PWA now redirects to the login page** instead of showing a bare "Authentication required" error; the requested URL is carried through `/login?next=` and the conversion resumes automatically after login ([#26](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/26)).
- **`GET /share` is now auth-gated.** Share intents from a logged-out device go straight to the login page and return to the shared URL after login — no more lost share-target URLs. Instances with `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE=disabled` are unaffected ([#26](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/26)).

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Permalink bar hidden by ad-blockers (e.g. uBlock Origin). Renamed all `share-bar` / `share-url` / `share-copy-btn` CSS classes and IDs to `permalink-bar` / `permalink-url` / `permalink-copy-btn` so cosmetic filter lists no longer suppress the element.
- Service Worker: removed the aggressive forced tab-reload on SW activation that had been introduced as a debugging artifact.

### Changed
- **`:latest` Docker tag now tracks the most recent release again.** The v1 → v2 migration grace period is over; self-hosters who want to pin v1 should use `:1` or `:1.2`.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Rendered Markdown view in the PWA** (closes [#23](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/23), thanks @sladg). New `Raw | Rendered` segmented toggle in the result header lets users see the fetched output as actual formatted HTML (headings, lists, links, images, tables, blockquotes, code blocks) instead of the raw source. Raw remains the default; the chosen mode is persisted in `localStorage` (`pullmd-view-mode`).
  - GFM rendering via self-hosted [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) v12.0.2 (~30 KB).
  - HTML sanitization via self-hosted [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) v3.4.2 (~20 KB). Strips scripts, inline styles, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs.
  - Rendered links open in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
  - Lazy first-render: the rendered DOM is only built when the user first switches to Rendered for a given result, so users who only ever copy raw Markdown pay no rendering cost.
  - Copy button still copies the raw Markdown source regardless of the active view.
  - Both themes (dark + paper) styled via existing CSS variables — no new tokens.
- Service Worker precaches the new vendor files (`vendor/marked.min.js`, `vendor/purify.min.js`) so the rendered view also works offline in the installed PWA. `CACHE_NAME` bumped to `pullmd-v20`.

### Notes
- Out of scope for v2.4: syntax highlighting, math/diagrams, Reddit-style spoiler syntax, side-by-side view, rendered view for `/s/:id` share links (still pure `text/markdown`).

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code flow** with PKCE-S256 for the claude.ai web custom connector, Claude Desktop's custom-connector dialog, and other MCP-spec-compliant clients (closes [#6](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/6), [#10](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/10) — thanks @WinFuture23 for raising the Claude Desktop auth gap).
  - Dynamic Client Registration (`POST /oauth/register`, RFC 7591).
  - Authorization endpoint (`GET /oauth/authorize`) with server-rendered consent screen (DE/EN).
  - Token endpoint (`POST /oauth/token`) with `authorization_code` and `refresh_token` grants. Refresh tokens are rotated on every refresh; reuse triggers chain-wide invalidation.
  - Revocation endpoint (`POST /oauth/revoke`, RFC 7009).
  - Discovery: `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414) and `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728).
  - Access tokens are HS256 JWTs (`typ: at+jwt`, RFC 9068), audience-bound to `<PUBLIC_URL>/mcp`, 1h TTL. Refresh tokens are opaque, sha256-hashed in storage, 30d TTL.
  - Hardcoded redirect-URI allowlist: `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` and `https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback`.
  - `WWW-Authenticate` 401 responses include the `resource_metadata` parameter pointing at the protected-resource metadata document.
- Rate limiting on `/oauth/token` and `/oauth/authorize` (60 req/min/IP) and `/oauth/register` (10 req/h/IP).
- CORS on `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/register`, `/oauth/revoke`, `/.well-known/*`, and `/mcp` (wildcard origin, no credentials — Bearer header travels independently).

### Changed
- `lib/auth.js` middleware accepts a third bearer-token type (OAuth JWT) via an injected verifier. Sessions and API keys (`pmd_*`) continue working unchanged.

### Configuration
- New env var `OAUTH_JWT_SECRET` enables OAuth. Must be 32+ chars. Generate via `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- `PUBLIC_URL` is required when OAuth is enabled (used as JWT `iss`/`aud` and in discovery metadata).

### Migration
- New tables `oauth_clients`, `oauth_auth_codes`, `oauth_refresh_tokens` are created automatically on first boot. No manual SQL.
- OAuth is **opt-in** — without `OAUTH_JWT_SECRET`, behavior is unchanged from v2.2.x. See `MIGRATION.md` for the full upgrade path.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Site Recipe Engine** (closes [#18](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/18)). Declarative `site-recipes.json` for per-host preprocess, fetch, select, and extractor rules. Default recipes ship in the repo (`site-recipes.default.json`); self-hosters can mount `data/site-recipes.json` or set `PULLMD_SITE_RECIPES` to point elsewhere. Four recipe categories:
  - `preprocess` — DOM cleanup actions (`remove-attr`, `remove-class`, `remove-element`, `unwrap`) applied before extraction
  - `fetch` — render forcing (`render: force|skip`), wait-for selector, mobile UA
  - `select` — extra remove-selectors added to `cleanDom`
  - `extractor` — preferred extractor per host (`readability`, `trafilatura`, `playwright`)
- Public endpoint `GET /api/recipes/status` (no auth) — counts loaded/rejected recipes per source for monitoring.
- Cache invalidation on recipe change. When recipe content changes between server boots, all cache rows become stale and re-extract on next access (lazy, on-demand).
- Playwright sidecar accepts new optional fields: `waitFor` (CSS selector), `waitTimeoutMs` (capped at 15 000), `mobileUa` (boolean). Backwards compatible — old fields are silently passed through.
- Initial default recipes covering Future PLC sites (paywall + recommendation widgets — seeded by @WinFuture23's analysis in [#17](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/17)) and GitHub Issues (JS-rendered comments).
- Playwright sidecar bundles `playwright-stealth` to mitigate `navigator.webdriver`-style headless detection on JS-driven anti-bot pages.

### Known limitations
- Sites behind cookie-based consent walls (third-party CMP frameworks like TCF v2) are not unlocked by recipes alone in this release. Such sites redirect non-consenting visitors to a JS-rendered consent UI and only return article content once HttpOnly cookies are set after a click. Write a custom recipe with whatever combination of `select.remove`, `extractor`, and `fetch` settings works for your specific source.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- PWA: persist frontmatter toggle, comments toggle and comment depth across reloads via `localStorage` (keys `pullmd-frontmatter`, `pullmd-comments`, `pullmd-comment-depth`). Closes [#20](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/20).
- PWA: scroll to top when selecting a history/archive entry, so the new content is visible after click. Closes [#19](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/19).

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-02

> **Breaking:** PullMD now supports an authentication system. Existing installs keep working unchanged (default `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE=disabled`); operators who want auth must follow [`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md).

> **Pulling v2.x:** Through 2026-05-13, `:latest` continued pointing at v1.x. Since v2.4.1 the `:latest` tag tracks v2.x again; self-hosters who want to stay on v1 should pin `:1` or `:1.2`.

### Added
- Three auth modes (`disabled` / `single-admin` / `multi-user`) controlled by `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE`.
- Web sessions: `POST /login`, `POST /logout`, `GET /signup`, `GET /api/me`, server-rendered HTML for `/login` and `/signup`.
- Per-user API keys: `pmd_<32-char-base62>` format, sent as `Authorization: Bearer pmd_xxx`. Manage at `/settings`. Stored as SHA-256 hashes.
- Per-user history: `/api/history` and `/api/archive` are scoped to `req.user` when authenticated.
- Admin CLI: `node scripts/admin.js {list-users,reset-password,make-admin}`.
- Schema: `users`, `sessions`, `api_keys`, `user_fetches` tables, plus `conversions.user_id`.
- Argon2id password hashing.

### Changed
- `/api`, `/api/stream`, `/mcp`, `/api/history`, `/api/archive`, `/api/cache/:id`, `DELETE /api/cache` require auth when mode != `disabled`.
- `/s/:id` share links remain public in all modes (design choice).
- `/api/config` now exposes `authMode`.

### Deprecated
- `PULLMD_AUTH_TOKEN` (legacy bearer compat) — works only in `single-admin` mode, removed in v3.0.

### Security
- Internal v2.0 security review (`REVIEW-FINDINGS.md` in the v2.0 release commit) tightened `DELETE /api/cache*` to admin-only in non-`disabled` modes and stopped flashing new API keys through URLs.

### Migration
See `MIGRATION.md`.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **User-Agent rotation** from a real-world UA pool with static seed fallback (closes [#14](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/14), thanks @WinFuture23). Sites that silently degraded responses to the previous hardcoded Chrome 131 UA now extract cleanly.
- **Charset detection from HTML meta tags** when `Content-Type` lacks a `charset` directive (closes [#8](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/8), thanks @WinFuture23). Eliminates mojibake on legacy ISO-8859-1 pages (e.g. `winfuture.de`).
- **Share URL embedded in MCP frontmatter responses** so LLMs stop hallucinating `pullmd.com` as the host instead of the operator's actual instance (closes [#1](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/1), [#9](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/9), thanks @looselyhuman and @WinFuture23).
- **HTML preprocessing** to recover dropped paragraphs adjacent to inline recommendation widgets, plus per-host extractor override (closes [#17](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/17), thanks @WinFuture23 — analysis that later seeded the v2.2 recipe engine).
- **GHCR mirror** for all three images alongside Docker Hub (closes [#13](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/13), thanks @Kampe).
- `DISABLE_PUBLIC_HISTORY` env var to hide the history/archive views on shared instances (closes [#7](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/7)).

### Fixed
- **Reddit threads with embedded images:** post selftext now renders before the media block, so the header is visible alongside the image and the comment tree is no longer truncated (closes [#12](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/12)).
- **Docker volume mount path:** `/app/data` corrected to `/data` so the documented bind mount actually works (closes [#15](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/15), PR [#16](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/pull/16) — thanks @andrewthetechie).

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **MCP response shape:** `read_url`, `get_share`, `list_recent` no longer return `structuredContent` alongside `content[0].text`. Claude Code and other MCP clients were surfacing the metadata JSON instead of the actual Markdown (closes [#1](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/1), originally reported by @looselyhuman; upstream Anthropic bug tracked at `anthropics/claude-code#54450`).
- **Reddit images:** image renders before selftext to match Reddit's visual order, so the header/title isn't suppressed by the image preview.
- CI matrix corrected so all three images (pullmd, pullmd-trafilatura, pullmd-playwright) properly publish to Docker Hub at `:1.1.3` / `:1.1` / `:1` / `:latest`, alongside GHCR.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Delete button in the recents list on the homepage. Each row gets a discreet `×` on hover — same one-click pattern as the archive view. `opacity: 0` by default, fades in on row hover.

### Changed
- `cache.history()` now includes the row `id` so the PWA can issue `DELETE /api/cache/:id` straight from the recents list.
- Service Worker cache bumped v17 → v18.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Readonly `<input>` values surface as `<code>`.** Click-to-copy widgets on CMS-driven sites (API model slugs, embed snippets, share links) used to hide their content in `<input type="text" readonly value="…">`, which `node-html-markdown` silently dropped as form chrome. They now come through as inline code. Only `readonly` text inputs are transformed; real forms are untouched.
- **Bare-UUID alt-text on images is dropped.** Strapi/Directus/Hygraph etc. leak asset IDs as the `alt` attribute. A strict UUID-v4 regex on the alt — drop the alt only, keep the image link. Descriptive alt text is preserved.

### Verified
- Diffed against 9 representative URLs (paulgraham.com, hillelwayne.com, 12factor.net, joelonsoftware.com, grugbrain.dev, RFC 2324, Wikipedia, HN frontpage) → byte-identical output. mistral.ai/pricing → expected diff (model slugs now `code`, UUID alts dropped).

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Playwright fallback for JavaScript-rendered pages.** When Readability + Trafilatura returns body-soup or low-quality output, the pipeline retries via headless Chromium and re-extracts on the rendered DOM. Source label is `playwright`; predicate reason is preserved in `metadata.extractorReason`.
- **New Python sidecar `pullmd-playwright`** (FastAPI + Chromium, `asyncio.Semaphore` concurrency limit, 20 s hard timeout, soft-fail networkidle wait). Optional — leave `PLAYWRIGHT_URL` unset and the pipeline silently degrades to static extraction.
- **Live status events for the PWA via Server-Sent Events.** New `GET /api/stream` endpoint emits `fetching → extracting → (rendering) → result`. Other clients (`curl`, Claude, MCP) continue to use `/api` unchanged.
- `lib/render-decision.js` — predicate over (i) readability fellback + thin, (ii) body-soup signature heading/paragraph ratio, (iii) low-quality safety net.
- `?render=force` and `?render=skip` manual overrides on both `/api` and `/api/stream`.
- Frontend status line under the spinner with i18n (DE/EN); EventSource auto-falls-back to plain fetch on transport failure.
- `client_mode` query-param fallback so PWA-originated SSE requests keep their attribution.
- Cache-ordering fix from the unreleased v1.0.3 included here: re-fetched URLs bubble to the top of the recents list.

### Operator notes
- The Playwright sidecar image is ~3.7 GB on disk (pulls Chromium on first build).
- `/api/stream` and `?render=force` are not rate-limited — recommended to keep PullMD behind an authenticating reverse proxy when exposed to the public internet.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-27

### Added
First public release. Self-hosted URL → Markdown service for humans and AI agents — PWA, REST, MCP, and a downloadable Claude Code skill, all from one container.

- **Multi-strategy extraction.** Cloudflare's native Markdown endpoint where available; Readability + Trafilatura running in parallel, picked by quality score elsewhere.
- **Reddit-aware path.** Auto-detects threads (incl. `redd.it` and `/s/` share links), returns post + nested comment tree with tunable `comment_depth` / `comment_limit`.
- **Refreshable share IDs.** Every conversion gets an 8-hex permalink; `GET /s/:id` re-fetches if older than 1h, falls back to the last good snapshot if the source dies.
- **Four interfaces, one codebase.** PWA frontend, REST (`/api`), MCP (`POST /mcp`, Streamable-HTTP), downloadable Claude Code skill bundle.
- **Multi-arch images** (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) on Docker Hub.

### Fixed
- First-boot DB file error on Docker volume mounts (thanks @goran-zdjelar, [#2](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/2)).
